### Chair of Trustees

Our Chair of Trustees and co-founder of New Life Support is one in a million. The mission of the charity and desire of Rob is to improve the lives of young people in Goole and East Yorkshire. Rob has been around in the voluntary sector for more than 20 years and likes nothing better than to connect people together in networking opportunities and if the conversation includes good coffee then Rob is happy. Over the years Rob has learnt to plan his time well, a skill which will prove invaluable as he currently holds the Councillor role of Portfolio Holder for Communities, Crime Prevention and Culture with Hull City Council. Rob can always find somewhere interesting to visit or something to do in his home city of Hull, but he can also be spotted visiting other cities, including cake at Bettyâ€™s in York or exploring London.
