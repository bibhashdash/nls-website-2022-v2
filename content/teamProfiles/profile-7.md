# Jonathan Whitehouse

### Youth Worker

Jonathan is the encourager, inspirer and great story teller. As well as his youth and community work during the week, you may see him running at the parkrun or pounding the paths of Goole and beyond. Going by the hashtag #TheRunningRev Jonathan loves sharing his faith in God, preaching in churches around the region and has just written a book called ‘A Pioneers Perspective’.
