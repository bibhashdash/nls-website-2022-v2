# Liz Green

### Community Development Worker

I support the financial administration and other back-room aspects of New Life Support, all with a passion to see people go beyond their comfort zone, conquer fears, and rise to new opportunities. I love the fact that NLS trains youth workers, community activists and brings opportunities and experiences to many local people. I am looking forward to seeing some new activities taking place in other areas of East Yorkshire and beyond, as well as Goole and Kingswood, Hull. To relax I can think of nothing better than a good book, or a meal with friends and/or family â€“ if there is a lake or a mountain to gaze at, paddleboard on or climb - even better.
