# Eloise

### Volunteer

I love all things outdoors, adventure and getting involved in social action. I have volunteered with New Life Support, alongside guiding, in one way or another for the last four years, am a founding member of Goole Paddlesports NLS and have recently qualified as a Paddlesport Instructor, Swimming Instructor and work as a Lifeguard. I enjoy camping with friends, travelling on the train and I am studying in York in Outdoor Adventure Sport.
