# Belinda

### Volunteer

Belinda has been at the heart of the hospitality for our Lunchbox Gold fortnightly ‘drop in’ for adults. Hot drinks, activities, friendship, and a Pay-As-You-Feel lunch were warmly received, and Belinda is a great host. Alongside Belinda’s experience of working with adults and children in various job roles and church ministry, she is also a great speaker, making the Bible and life stories become real and relevant to help people in their own lives. Belinda flourishes as a homemaker, providing hospitality and when she is relaxing she loves to be at home or in the garden with her husband Deon and dog ‘Milo’.
