# NLS launch 'Lunchbox Gold'

### 26th October, 2021

We are excited to launch a new member to our Revive Goole/ New Life Support occasions.

'Lunchbox Gold' starts at 10.30am fortnightly from Tuesday 2nd November

Adults can drop in for a cuppa and/or come for our community lunch (served at 12 noon).

Food is served on a ‘Pay as you feel’ PAYF basis - so no financial reason not to join us. If you find it hard to pay this week then you are not under any pressure.

We will shape the morning with those who come along - Belinda will chat and join in with the mornings, there will be activities to take part in.

At 1.15pm we start our Chariot Book Club. We are excited to open up some books of the Bible together!

For more information - please contact us - or turn up on Tuesday!
