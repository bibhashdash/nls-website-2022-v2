# Lunchbox Goole win award

### 28th February, 2022

Lunchbox Goole have been awarded the "Contribution to the Community" award at this year's Goole & Howdenshire Business Excellence Awards.

In a stunning evening presentation at Goole Academy, our free meals service beat off competition from two other local charities to land the gong.

Goole & District Community Transport Group/The Goole GoFar and Clean Goole Campaign Group were the other two nominees.

The award was sponsored by Jos Richardson & Son.

Lunchbox Goole were also nominated for the Covid-19 award and the Team of the Year awards.

The awards night was hosted by TV personality Harry Gration, with Liverpool-based comedian Jamie Sutherland providing the evening's entertainment.

All of us at New Life Support are incredibly proud of our achievement and we'd like to thank the people of Goole for their support and love throughout the lockdown and beyond.
