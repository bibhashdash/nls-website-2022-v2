# Splashes of fun at Goole canal

### 23rd April, 2021

New Life Support had the amazing pleasure of hosting a fun-filled day of paddlesports at Goole Canal on 17th April, with local residents making the most of the sunny weather.

Under blue skies, ages 11 and up took part in paddleboarding and kayaking led by Mike Ryder coaching.

Steve Green, coordinator at NLS, said: "It's wonderful to see both children and adults taking so well to the lessons.

"There's been several splashes into the cool waters, but that's part of the fun!

"We hope that more of Goole's youth will join in sessions further down the line."
