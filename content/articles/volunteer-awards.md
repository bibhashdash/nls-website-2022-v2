# Proud to Bee a volunteer

### 9th October, 2021

New Life Support's very own Liz Green was among 48 volunteering individuals and groups nominated for the Proud to Bee a Volunteer awards.

The Hull and East Yorkshire Smile Foundation's flagship recognition ceremony was streamed live on Wednesday 6th October and saw Liz nominated for the Sports Volunteer Award (Sponsored by Active Humber).

As part of NLS's effort to engage the young people of Goole, Liz has worked tirelessly to organise the paddlesports sessions at Goole Canal during the summer.

It allows youth to experience new activities and build on existing hobbies, ensuring they can add to their skillsets. The sessions have also included family, adults & #shepaddles times.

"Getting the nomination has made me smile," she said. "It is hard work behind the scenes of volunteering and in any charity work. But the pleasure of enjoying the paddlesport together in our town is so good.

"HEY Smile provide support & champion charities & volunteers over the region so to be included means a lot to me."

Alongside Liz in the nominations pool were Ryan Gibbons and Paul Dolan (City of Hull Boxing Club), Conleth Campbell (Elloughton Blackburn Football Club), Val French (Pocklington Tennis Club / Breeze Cycling and Pocklington Rugby in the Community), and Albert Hardy (Goole Boxing Club).

The highly commended award went to Val French and the winners were Ryan Gibbons and Paul Dolan of City of Hull Boxing Club.
