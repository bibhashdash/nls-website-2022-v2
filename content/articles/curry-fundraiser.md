# Curry giveaway at Lunchbox Goole

New Life Support will be giving away free curry meals to raise funds towards the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic in India.

On Saturday May 15, pop down to Revive Church on Mariner's street between 5 and 7pm for this Lunchbox Goole special event, with money raised going to British based charity Khalsa Aid who are currently doing vital work on the ground in India.

NLS volunteer Bibhash Dash, who is originally from India, will be cooking up batches of a special Chicken Kohlapuri curry and rice for you to take away.

We do have a suggested donation of Â£5 but please give what you can.

"The situation in India is heartbreaking," Bibhash said. "My family and friends are currently living in fear of the unknown.

"Vast populations have been left devastated by this pandemic, and coupled with the lack of infrastructure - particularly in rural areas - this means many thousands more could die before we see a recovery.

"I've had the privilege of serving our community in Goole, where I've lived for the last 5 years, during the pandemic and lockdown in 2020.

"I hope that once again, the people of Goole will rise up and provide support like no other."

Along with the curry dish, we also have a mystery box to giveaway thanks to the help of our amazing Lunchbox Goole volunteers.
